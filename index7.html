                            Argentina’s Paraná Delta is on fire, and conservationists are sounding the alarm, 
                            warning that this major ecosystem could be devastated beyond repair.
                        </p>

                            The delta system, which spans 19,300 square kilometers (7,450 square miles) in eastern Argentina, 
                            is an intricate network of islands, streams, lagoons, marshlands, grasslands and forests, 
                            that crisscross the Paraná River, the second-largest river in South America. The region, 
                            which runs through Argentina’s Entre Rios province, hosts an abundance of 
                            <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309149131_The_Parana_River_Delta">wildlife species</a>, 
                            including 50 mammals, 260 birds, 200 fish, 37 reptiles and 27 amphibians. 
                            The Paraná Delta also plays an important role in regulating water and sequestering carbon, according to 
                            <a href="http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2020/06/25/el-delta-en-llamas-incendios-en-las-islas-del-bajo-parana/">experts</a>.

                            While scientists believe that fire has occurred naturally in the Paraná Delta in the past, 
                            most fires in the region are deliberately ignited by people. This year is no exception.

                            “The burning of herbaceous wetlands is a usual management practice in the Paraná River 
                            floodplain and in the Delta,” Patricia Kandus, an ecologist and professor at the 
                            Universidad Nacional de San Martín in Buenos Aires, told Mongabay in an emailed statement. 
                            “However, burning practices are not allowed without permissions and most intentional 
                            fires are usually not declared by the farmers.”

                            In recent months, the fires have gotten “quite out of control” due to unusually high temperatures, 
                            regional drought conditions and the lack of rainfall, Kandus said.

                            that native species may present,”

                            Satellites from the U.S. space agency NASA detected more than 10,000 fire alerts between 
                            in 2020 in Entre Rios, the vast majority of which occurred in June and July. 
                            This number is considered exceptionally high compared to the same period in years past.

                            “The number of potential fire hotspots accumulated this year far exceeds the number of hotspots

                            at Greenpeace Argentina, told Mongabay in an email.

                            Mingo said in a statement in Spanish. “So far this year there have been 
                            approximately 12,000 outbreaks of fires, and only 7,000 in July. 
                            This delta is a large system of wetlands and it is clear that these ecosystems urgently 
                            need protection as they are seriously threatened by the agricultural and real estate industry.”

                            To make matters worse, the Paraná Delta region has experienced some of the lowest water levels 
                            in recent months. In Rosario, a port city that hugs the western shore of the Paraná, 
                            river levels have plummeted, exposing parts of the shoreline that have been underwater for nearly 50 years. 
                            Large cargo ships, which normally sail down the river carrying several thousand tons of corn and soy, 
                            have needed to reduce their loads to avoid grounding, which has caused local industries to

                            the Paraná River basin is blanketed in a dark blue hue as water fills the delta’s many marshes, lagoons and streams. 
                            But in a more recent image, taken on July 3, 2020, there are only thin ribbons of water meandering through the delta.

                            The most considerable drop happened on May 21 this year, when a river gauge near Rosario measured water levels 
                            to be a mere 8 centimeters (3 inches).

                            Andrés Antico, a climatologist at Argentina’s National Scientific and Technical Research Council 
                            and National University of the Littoral, says that low water levels in the Paraná River are caused by 
                            “a severe and prolonged drought that is occurring in southern Brazil, Paraguay, and northern Argentina,” 
                            which started at the beginning of this year. However, he said that the exact “climatic” causes 
                            of the drought have yet to be determined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “La Niña events are usually associated with such low levels,” Antico told Mongabay in an email. 
                            “But no La Niña occurred this year. That is, we cannot blame a La Niña event for the current Paraná low levels. 
                            Likewise, it is difficult (if not impossible) to discuss the possible role of climate change 
                            in the current Paraná basin drought. Future studies will probably shed some light on this.”
